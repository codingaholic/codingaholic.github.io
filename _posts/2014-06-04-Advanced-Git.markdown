description: "Now that Git has been in the wild for several years, leading edge developers and projects are considering it their primary source code control tool of choice. Distributed version control systems have so much to offer, but are you using Git and its DVCS capabilities to their fullest? This talk assumes a working basic knowledge of Git and, quicly progressing from from there, explores some of the intermediate to advanced uses of this unique version control tool. We will work through examples of powerful features including interactive rebase, rebase-on-pull, external diff tools, rerere, advanced logging features, the RefLog, and the reset command."
