description: "
    It takes time to become really good at something. Time, commitment and a genuine passion. If you're not having fun the learning is a chore, if you are then it hardly feels like learning at all, at least not like the thing they made you do in school. Craftsmanship is about making that commitment and then figuring out how to see it through. Using examples of mastery from various fields and a thirty year paper-folding habit, Dan describes some of the many facets of craftsmanship and tries to figure out exactly what the craft is that we programmers do.
