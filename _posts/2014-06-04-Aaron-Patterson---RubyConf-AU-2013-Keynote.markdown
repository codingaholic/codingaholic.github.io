description: "
    (our slide recording device crapped out half way - so for the last 20 minutes, there's no slides - sorry!)  Aaron Patterson is one of Rubyâ€™s most respected and loved programmers. A committer to both Ruby and Ruby on Rails and a member of Seattle's Ruby community, he also has a sense of humour that has endeared him to many audiences.
