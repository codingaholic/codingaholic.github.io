    You've seen the demos, read the articles and perhaps even started to use SignalR in a project, but now you're ready for the nitty gritty. What are the best patterns for using SignalR in a real application? How do you deal with users and authorization? How does it work with your favorite IoC container? How do you flow data from back-end systems to SignalR clients? How do you successfully self-host SignalR along side other OWIN compliant frameworks like Nancy and ASP.NET Web API?
